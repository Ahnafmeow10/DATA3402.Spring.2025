## Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project is from a Kaggle challenge called [Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 1](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1).

The goal is to predict if a customer will leave a bank or not. This is called customer churn. We are given a dataset with information about each customer, like their credit score, age, country, gender, how long theyâ€™ve been with the bank, and their account details. The column we want to predict is called `Exited`. It shows 1 if the customer left, and 0 if they stayed. We train a machine learning model using this data and make predictions for new customers.

## Data Loading and Initial Look

We used `pandas` to load the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files and inspected the number of rows, columns, and feature types. We checked for missing values and created a table describing each feature's type, range, and outliers.

## Data Visualization

We compared the distribution of each feature across the two classes: customers who stayed (`Exited = 0`) and those who left (`Exited = 1`). Histograms were used for numerical features, and bar plots for categorical ones. This helped identify that age, balance, number of products, and geography were important features for predicting churn.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation for Machine Learning

We removed non-useful columns like IDs and names. Categorical variables (`Gender`, `Geography`) were one-hot encoded. Numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to prepare for modeling. We visualized each feature before and after scaling to confirm the transformation worked correctly.

## Machine Learning

We used a Random Forest Classifier. The data was split into training, validation, and test sets. The model was trained on the training set, and its performance was evaluated using accuracy and a classification report. Finally, predictions were made on the Kaggle test set, and the results were saved to `submission.csv`.
